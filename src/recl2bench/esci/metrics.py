"""Search metrics with graded, incomplete labels (ESCI).

Conventions (pre-registered in PREREGISTRATION_ESCI.md):
- `labels` maps product_id -> "E" | "S" | "C" | "I" for the query; anything absent is
  UNJUDGED.
- Strict precision@k: relevant = E; unjudged counts as not relevant.
- Lenient precision@k: relevant = E or S; unjudged counts as not relevant.
- Judged-only ("condensed") precision@k: unjudged items are removed from the ranking
  first, then strict precision@k is computed on what remains (Sakai, 2007).
- judged@k: share of the top-k that carries any label.
- NDCG@10 with ESCI gains E=1, S=0.1, C=0.01, I=0; unjudged gain 0; ideal ranking
  built from all judged products of the query.
- Recall@k: share of the query's E products that appear in the top-k.
